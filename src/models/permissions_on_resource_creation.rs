/*
 * 3DS OUTSCALE API
 *
 * Welcome to the OUTSCALE API documentation.<br /><br />  The OUTSCALE API enables you to manage your resources in the OUTSCALE Cloud. This documentation describes the different actions available along with code examples.<br /><br />  Note that the OUTSCALE Cloud is compatible with Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, but some resources have different names in AWS than in the OUTSCALE API. You can find a list of the differences [here](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/3DS+OUTSCALE+APIs+Reference).<br /><br />  You can also manage your resources using the [Cockpit](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/About+Cockpit) web interface.
